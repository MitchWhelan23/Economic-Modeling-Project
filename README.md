# Mathematical Modeling Capstone Project  
**Modeling Competition and Cooperation Between Economic Firms Using Differential Equations**  

## üìå Overview  
This repository contains the final project for my **Mathematical Modeling Capstone** course at Northeastern University. Working in a team of two, we developed and analyzed mathematical models that describe competition and cooperation between economic firms. Our approach was based on constructing and analyzing **systems of differential equations** to capture the dynamic interactions between firms under varying assumptions.  

The project highlights my ability to:  
- Apply advanced mathematics (differential equations, stability analysis, numerical methods) to real-world economic systems.  
- Translate abstract theory into real-world applications.  
- Collaborate effectively on a large-scale research project.  
- Communicate results clearly through both models and written documentation.
